### In K8s, there are namespaced and non-namespaced objects (they usually, but not always, have the Cluster prefix)
### Example of namespaced objects: Deployment, Pod, ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, Secret, Role, RoleBinding
### Example of non-namespaced objects: ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, CustomResourceDefinition
### In most cases, objects created in a namespace can only be used within the same namespace. For example, if you create a ConfigMap
### in the 'default' namespace, you will not be able to mount it on a Pod that is running in the 'kube-system' namespace; nevertheless,
### if an application that runs in that Pod has permissions to read ConfigMaps in the 'default' namespace, it will still be able to
### read that ConfigMap but not mount it.
### Namespaces provide RBAC (Role Based Access Control) isolation by default, but they do not provide network isolation. For example,
### if a user is 'locked' in the 'monitoring' namespace with, it will not be able to list Pods or read Secrets in the 'kube-system'
### namespace; however, it will be able to access Pods or Services via internal IP addresses
### Network isolation is something that requires more effort to be configured.
